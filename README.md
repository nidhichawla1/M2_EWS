# M2_EWS
According to a recent survey, there are 37 million blind persons worldwide, 15 million of them live in India. Worse, 75% of these blindness cases may have been avoided. As a result, there is a critical need for improvement in the status of the visually impaired in India. Obstacle detection is a difficult and time-consuming task for visually impaired people.The Electronic Walking Stick (EWS) is a suggestion that will assist the user in detecting obstacles. It can automatically detect an impediment in front of the person and provide feedback by shaking the walking stick and emitting a warning sound for the user while also acknowledging the surrounding people.
